# Properties Panel Refactor Progress

This document tracks the status of the Properties Panel refactor tasks.

## Completed
- Pre-refactor analysis captured in `PROPERTIES_PANEL_ANALYSIS.md`
- Snapshot baseline tests for shape, text, image, drawing, drawPath, videoEmbed, and svgPath objects
- Interaction probes for position, size, color, text, animation, and hand follower settings
- Constants module encoding numeric ranges, steps, and default values for panel controls

## In Progress
- None

## Pending
- Create modular skeleton under `features/properties-panel/`
- Shim existing `components/panels/PropertiesPanel.tsx` to re-export new UI orchestrator
- Move object editors (Text, Shape, Image, SvgPath, Animation, Layer order) into modular structure
- Centralize validation and normalization rules and wire editors through them
- Add responsiveness and performance guard rails (render containment, memoization, debounced updates, undo batching, narrow selectors)
- Preserve single-select behavior; defer multi-select support
- Migrate hand follower block into SvgPath editor, keeping calibration and default-merging logic
- Encode animation defaults for SVG paths in `normalization.ts`
- Ensure backward-compatible import paths and prop names
- Expand testing: maintain snapshot parity, interaction probes, performance smoke test for slider drag
- Verify no layout regressions and animation defaults match legacy behavior
