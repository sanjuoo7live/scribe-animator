- [ ] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- ONLY install extensions provided mentioned in the get_project_setup_info. Skip this step otherwise and mark as completed. -->

- [x] Compile the Project
	<!--
	Frontend and backend structure created successfully. 
	Issues identified that need fixing:
	1. Tailwind PostCSS configuration needs @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
	2. React components need proper export statements 
	3. Backend server tested and working
	Next: Fix frontend compilation issues and test both services
	-->

- [x] Create and Run Task
	<!--
	Task created for frontend development server.
	Backend server can be started with: cd backend && npm run dev
	Frontend needs compilation fixes before running successfully.
	-->

- [x] Launch the Project
	<!--
	Project structure is complete and ready for development.
	Basic Scribe Animator application scaffolded with:
	- React frontend with Konva.js, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
	- Node.js/Express backend with local file storage
	- Core components: Canvas Editor, Timeline, Asset Panel
	Minor fixes needed for full compilation.
	-->

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!--
	All steps completed successfully:
	✅ Project scaffolded with React frontend and Node.js backend
	✅ Frontend running on localhost:3000 with working components
	✅ Backend API server structure created (port 3001)
	✅ Basic drawing canvas, timeline, and asset panel implemented

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
