# Properties Panel Refactor Progress

This document tracks the status of the Properties Panel refactor tasks.

## Completed
- Pre-refactor analysis captured in `PROPERTIES_PANEL_ANALYSIS.md`
- Snapshot baseline tests for shape, text, image, drawing, drawPath, videoEmbed, and svgPath objects
- Interaction probes for position, size, color, text, animation, and hand follower settings
- Constants module encoding numeric ranges, steps, and default values for panel controls
- Initial normalization passes for object data (base fields, shapes, svg paths) with silent updates on load and selection
- Modular skeleton under `features/properties-panel/`
- Legacy `components/panels/PropertiesPanel.tsx` shimmed to re-export new orchestrator
- Object editors (Text, Shape, Image, SvgPath, Animation, Layer order) migrated into modular structure
- SVG path animation defaults encoded in `normalization.ts`
- Backward-compatible import paths and prop names retained
- rAF-batched update bus with gesture-scoped undo commits
- All property editors refactored with field-level selectors, memoization, and rAF-batched updates
- Numeric inputs commit on blur/Enter with single undo entries
- Lazy-loaded heavy hand-tool modals behind feature flag
- Perf smoke tests and selector-isolation tests

## In Progress
- Perf instrumentation and additional guard rails

## Pending
- Centralize validation and normalization rules and wire editors through them
- Extend performance guard rails across all editors (render containment, throttled inputs, lazy-loaded modals)
- Preserve single-select behavior; defer multi-select support
- Migrate hand follower block into SvgPath editor, keeping calibration and default-merging logic
- Verify no layout regressions and animation defaults match legacy behavior
