# Properties Panel Refactor Progress

This document tracks the status of the Properties Panel refactor tasks.

## Completed
- Pre-refactor analysis captured in `PROPERTIES_PANEL_ANALYSIS.md`
- Snapshot baseline tests for shape, text, image, drawing, drawPath, videoEmbed, and svgPath objects
- Interaction probes for position, size, color, text, animation, and hand follower settings
- Constants module encoding numeric ranges, steps, and default values for panel controls
- Initial normalization passes for object data (base fields, shapes, svg paths) with silent updates on load and selection
- Modular skeleton under `features/properties-panel/`
- Legacy `components/panels/PropertiesPanel.tsx` shimmed to re-export new orchestrator
- Object editors (Text, Shape, Image, SvgPath, Animation, Layer order) migrated into modular structure
- SVG path animation defaults encoded in `normalization.ts`
- Backward-compatible import paths and prop names retained

## In Progress
- None

## Pending
- Centralize validation and normalization rules and wire editors through them
- Add responsiveness and performance guard rails (render containment, memoization, debounced updates, undo batching, narrow selectors)
- Preserve single-select behavior; defer multi-select support
- Migrate hand follower block into SvgPath editor, keeping calibration and default-merging logic
- Expand testing: maintain snapshot parity, interaction probes, performance smoke test for slider drag
- Verify no layout regressions and animation defaults match legacy behavior
