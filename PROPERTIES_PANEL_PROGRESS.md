# Properties Panel Refactor Progress

This document tracks the status of the Properties Panel refactor tasks.

## Completed
- Pre-refactor analysis captured in `PROPERTIES_PANEL_ANALYSIS.md`
- Snapshot baseline tests for shape, text, image, drawing, drawPath, videoEmbed, and svgPath objects
- Interaction probes for position, size, color, text, animation, and hand follower settings
- Constants module encoding numeric ranges, steps, and default values for panel controls
- Initial normalization passes for object data (base fields, shapes, svg paths) with silent updates on load and selection
- Modular skeleton under `features/properties-panel/`
- Legacy `components/panels/PropertiesPanel.tsx` shimmed to re-export new orchestrator
- Object editors (Text, Shape, Image, SvgPath, Animation, Layer order) migrated into modular structure
- SVG path animation defaults encoded in `normalization.ts`
- Backward-compatible import paths and prop names retained
- rAF-batched update bus with gesture-scoped undo commits
- All property editors refactored with field-level selectors, memoization, and rAF-batched updates
- Numeric inputs commit on blur/Enter with single undo entries
- Lazy-loaded heavy hand-tool modals behind feature flag
- Throttled font-size and hand-scale sliders wired through schema-based normalization
- Perf smoke tests and selector-isolation tests
- Phase 4 â€” Extended Guardrails & Hand Follower Migration completed with responsive panel layout, render containment, schema-wired editors, and regression tests for animation defaults and layout
- Collapsible, responsive layout with render-contained editors and throttled opacity slider
- Hand follower defaults clamped via normalization orchestrator and animation defaults enforced

## In Progress
- Perf instrumentation and additional guard rails

## Pending
- Preserve single-select behavior; defer multi-select support
