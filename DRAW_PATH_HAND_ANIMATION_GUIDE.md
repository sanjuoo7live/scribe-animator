# Draw Path Editor & Hand Animation System

## Overview
The Draw Path Editor now supports asset-guided tracing and synchronized hand animations that create realistic whiteboard drawing effects.

## New Features

### 1. Semi-Transparent Asset Overlay
- **Asset Opacity Control**: Slider to adjust transparency (10-100%) of background asset for easier tracing
- **Visual Guide**: The imported character/asset appears as a semi-transparent overlay for precise tracing
- **Real-time Updates**: Opacity changes are immediately reflected in the canvas

### 2. Enhanced Tracing Experience
- **Continuous Path Drawing**: Mouse/tablet support for smooth path creation
- **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate large assets with zoom controls and click-to-pan
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time path preview while drawing
- **Multiple Path Support**: Save multiple paths per asset for complex drawings

### 3. Hand Animation System
- **Asset Selection**: Choose from 8 different hand gestures (pencil, pen, pointing, etc.)
- **Path Following**: Hand automatically follows the draw path with precise timing
- **Rotation Support**: Hand rotates to match drawing direction for natural movement
- **Synchronized Animation**: Hand movement perfectly synced with "drawIn" effect

### 4. Animation Types
- **drawIn**: Progressive path reveal (lines appear as they're being drawn)
- **pathFollow**: Hand follows path coordinates with smooth interpolation
- **Rotation Matching**: Hand angle adjusts to path direction for realistic drawing motion

## How to Use

### Step 1: Import Asset
1. Add your character/object image to Custom Assets
2. Click "Draw Path" on the asset to open the editor

### Step 2: Setup Canvas
1. Adjust asset opacity for comfortable tracing (30% recommended)
2. Use zoom controls for detailed work on large assets
3. Pan the canvas by clicking and dragging the viewport

### Step 3: Create Draw Path
1. Draw continuous paths by clicking and dragging on the asset
2. Name your path (e.g., "Character Outline", "Face Details")
3. Set duration (how long the drawing should take)
4. Choose stroke color and width
5. Save the path

### Step 4: Configure Hand Animation
1. Enable "Hand Animation" checkbox
2. Select appropriate hand asset (pencil ‚úèÔ∏è for drawing, pen üñäÔ∏è for writing)
3. The system will automatically create a synchronized hand that follows the path

### Step 5: Add to Canvas
1. Click the "+" button on your saved path
2. Both the draw path and hand animation are added to the timeline
3. The hand appears just before drawing starts and follows the path precisely

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Path Support
- Create separate paths for different parts (head, body, arms)
- Each path can have its own timing and hand animation
- Hand "lifts" between paths and repositions for natural flow

### Hand Behavior
- **Appearance**: Hand appears 0.1s before drawing starts
- **Following**: Moves smoothly along path nodes with interpolation
- **Rotation**: Automatically rotates to match path direction
- **Disappearance**: Fades out after completing the drawing

### Path Properties
- **Duration**: 0.1 to 30 seconds per path
- **Color**: Any hex color for stroke
- **Width**: 1-10 pixels stroke thickness
- **Points**: Unlimited path complexity

## Technical Implementation

### New Animation Type
- Added `pathFollow` to SceneObject animation types
- Implements smooth point-to-point interpolation
- Calculates rotation based on path direction vectors

### Canvas Rendering
- Enhanced drawPath rendering with progressive reveal
- Hand positioning calculated from path progress
- Synchronized timing between path drawing and hand movement

### Performance
- Efficient path interpolation using segment-based progress
- Minimal re-renders with React optimization
- Smooth 60fps animations for both path and hand

## Example Use Cases

### Educational Content
- Math problems with hand writing equations
- Science diagrams with pointing gestures
- Step-by-step tutorials with traced illustrations

### Marketing Videos
- Product sketches with realistic drawing motion
- Logo creation with hand-drawn effects
- Whiteboard presentations with human touch

### Character Animation
- Cartoon character creation with tracing
- Portrait drawing with natural hand movement
- Complex illustrations broken into multiple paths

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Path Complexity**: Keep paths reasonably simple for smooth animation
2. **Timing**: 2-4 seconds per path works well for most content
3. **Hand Selection**: Use pencil ‚úèÔ∏è for drawing, pen üñäÔ∏è for writing, pointing üëâ for emphasis
4. **Asset Quality**: Higher resolution assets provide better tracing precision
5. **Path Order**: Draw paths in logical order (outline first, details second)

The enhanced Draw Path Editor transforms static assets into dynamic, hand-drawn animations that engage viewers and create professional whiteboard video effects.


How to use your saved draw paths:

Step-by-Step Workflow:
Import Asset: Upload image to Custom Assets, click "Draw Path"
Switch to Draw Mode: Click "‚úèÔ∏è Draw" button (default mode)
Trace the Image: Click and drag to trace over the semi-transparent image
Save Path: Name it (e.g., "Character Outline") and click "Save Path"
Add to Canvas: Click the green "+ Add to Canvas" button
Check Timeline: You'll see your draw path object appear
Press Play: Watch the animated drawing effect!
What Happens When You Add to Canvas:
Draw Path Object: Creates an animated line that draws progressively
Hand Animation (if enabled): Creates a hand that follows the path
Timeline Integration: Both objects appear on your timeline
Synchronized Animation: Hand moves as the path draws
After Adding to Canvas:
Position: Drag the draw path object to position it on your canvas
Timing: Adjust animationStart and animationDuration in Properties panel
Styling: Change colors and stroke width in Properties
Layering: Use the layer controls to move paths front/back
Pro Tips:
Multiple Paths: Create separate paths for different parts (head, body, arms)
Hand Selection: Choose appropriate hand (‚úèÔ∏è for drawing, üñäÔ∏è for writing)
Path Order: Draw logical sequences (outline first, details second)
Duration: 2-4 seconds per path works well for most content
The key insight: Draw Path Editor creates the paths, then you add them to your main canvas where they become animated drawing effects!

Try it now - switch to Draw mode, trace over your image, save the path, then click "+ Add to Canvas" to see the magic happen! üé®
