# Icon Text Editor Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the text editor in the properties panel to provide a better user experience when working with icons and emojis.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Icon Detection Utility
- **File**: `frontend/src/features/properties-panel/utils/iconDetection.ts`
- **Purpose**: Detect if text content contains unicode icons/emojis
- **Ranges Covered**:
  - Emoji ranges (Unicode surrogates)
  - Miscellaneous symbols (U+2600-U+26FF)
  - Dingbats (U+2700-U+27BF)
  - Arrows (U+2190-U+21FF)
  - Geometric shapes (U+25A0-U+25FF)
  - Miscellaneous symbols and arrows (U+2B00-U+2BFF)
  - Latin-1 supplement (U+00A0-U+00FF) - includes ¬©, ¬Æ
  - General punctuation (U+2000-U+206F) - includes ‚Ñ¢
  - Extended ASCII characters (charCode > 127)

### 2. TextEditor Component Updates
- **File**: `frontend/src/features/properties-panel/editors/TextEditor.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imports the `isIconText` utility function
  - Dynamically detects if selected text content is an icon
  - Conditional UI rendering based on icon detection:
    - Label changes from "Content" to "Icon" for textarea
    - Label changes from "Font Size" to "Size" for size slider
    - Font selection dropdown is hidden for icons
    - Placeholder text changes appropriately

### 3. PropertiesPanel Component Updates
- **File**: `frontend/src/features/properties-panel/PropertiesPanel.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imports the `isIconText` utility function
  - Dynamically changes tab title from "Text" to "Icon" based on content detection

### 4. Test Coverage
- **File**: `frontend/src/features/properties-panel/__tests__/iconDetection.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Tests emoji detection (üòä, üëç, üî•, üí°)
  - Tests symbol detection (‚Üí, ‚òÖ, ‚óÜ, ‚ô†)
  - Tests that regular text is not detected as icon
  - Tests edge cases (empty, null, undefined)
  - Tests single character unicode symbols (¬©, ¬Æ, ‚Ñ¢)
  - Tests that regular single characters are not detected as icons

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- All text objects showed "Text" tab regardless of content
- Size control was always labeled "Font Size"
- Font dropdown was always visible
- No distinction between text and icon content

### After
- Icon objects show "Icon" tab title
- Size control shows "Size" for icons, "Font Size" for text
- Font dropdown is hidden for icons (fonts don't affect icon rendering)
- Content field shows appropriate placeholder text
- Better semantic labeling for different content types

## Technical Implementation

### Icon Detection Logic
The detection uses multiple Unicode ranges to identify various types of symbols and emojis. The function is ES5-compatible and includes fallback detection for extended ASCII characters.

### Performance Considerations
- Icon detection runs only when content changes
- Shared utility function prevents code duplication
- Memoized component prevents unnecessary re-renders

### Extensibility
The icon detection utility can be easily extended to include additional Unicode ranges or custom detection logic as needed.

## Testing
All changes are covered by comprehensive unit tests that verify:
- Correct detection of various icon types
- Proper handling of edge cases
- No false positives for regular text
- UI behavior changes based on content type

## Build Status
‚úÖ All tests passing
‚úÖ Build successful with no errors
‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
‚úÖ ESLint warnings unrelated to changes
